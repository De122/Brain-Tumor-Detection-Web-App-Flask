# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Web-App-Flask

In this project , I have predicted whether brain tumor is present or not in a given MRI image.

The dataset that I have taken is from Kaggle. Here is the link for the same : - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection

So i have performed preprocessing and various other tasks to get clean and accurate data which will be used for training. 
I have then used a deep learning neural network model along with some layers to train the dataset and predict brain tumor for a given MRI image.
